Description: The cfTools R package provides methods for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
    methylation data analysis to facilitate cfDNA-based studies. Given the 
    methylation sequencing data of a cfDNA sample, for each cancer marker 
    or tissue marker, we deconvolve the tumor-derived or tissue-specific reads 
    from all reads falling in the marker region. Our read-based deconvolution 
    algorithm exploits the pervasiveness of DNA methylation for signal enhancement, 
    therefore can sensitively identify a trace amount of tumor-specific or 
    tissue-specific cfDNA in plasma. cfTools provides functions for 
    (1) cancer detection: sensitively detect tumor-derived cfDNA and estimate 
    the tumor-derived cfDNA fraction (tumor burden); (2) tissue deconvolution: 
    infer the tissue type composition and the cfDNA fraction of multiple tissue 
    types for a plasma cfDNA sample. These functions can serve as foundations 
    for more advanced cfDNA-based studies, including cancer diagnosis and 
    disease monitoring.
